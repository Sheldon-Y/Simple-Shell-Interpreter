# Simple Shell Interpreter (C in VisualStudioCode)

Implemented a basic Unix shell interpreter that supports command parsing, execution, environment variable management, as well as input/output redirection and piping functionalities.

1. **Command Parsing**:
   - **Functionality**: Parses the user-entered command line text, including commands and their parameters, while handling special characters and quotes.
   - **Implementation Method**: Utilizes string manipulation functions to split user input, identifying commands and parameters. Implements a state machine to handle quotes and escape characters, ensuring complex command lines are parsed accurately.
2. **Command Execution**:
   - **Functionality**: Executes parsed commands, including both built-in and system commands.
   - **Implementation Method**: For built-in commands, directly executes corresponding functions within the Shell program. For system commands, uses `fork()` to create a child process, employs `exec()` family functions to replace the current process image in the child, and the parent process waits for completion with `wait()`.
3. **Environment Management**:
   - **Functionality**: Allows users to set and query environment variables.
   - **Implementation Method**: Employs a linked list to store key-value pairs of environment variables. Provides `setenv` and `getenv` commands to enable users to add, modify, or retrieve environment variables at runtime.
4. **Input/Output Redirection**:
   - **Functionality**: Supports redirecting command standard input and output to files.
   - **Implementation Method**: Parses command line for redirection symbols (e.g., `>` and `<`). Before executing commands, uses `freopen()` to reopen standard input or output file descriptors, redirecting data streams to specified files.
5. **Pipe Support**:
   - **Functionality**: Allows users to connect multiple commands via pipes (`|` symbol), where the output of one command serves as the input to another.
   - **Implementation Method**: For each pair of commands connected by a pipe, uses `pipe()` to create a pipe, `fork()` to spawn child processes, and `dup2()` in the child processes to redirect standard input or output to the pipe's read or write end. The main process controls the execution order and resource release of all child processes.
